# Hi, I'm Harrison

I'm a software developer who likes to occasionaly build things and see how software works under the hood. I'll be using this site as a portfolio and a place to practice writing about things I'm interested in, (mostly) centered around philosophy, physics, and politics. 

## 🧠 Job Experience(most recent)

- Worked as a software developer at Itron. I was on the DEM (Distributed Energy Management) team which helped manage energy efficiency programs and distributed energy resources. My work ranged from building out features in a large rails monolith to building data pipelines to ingest telemety from smart thermostats.
- Develop and maintain a website for a small business that handles customers booking appointments and the owner gets emails with the details.
- Spent 6 months in Arizona as a field organizer in the 2024 election becoming familiar with the political landscape. Knocked on over 4000 doors, managed and trained teams to canvass(knock on doors), both remotely and in person to get out the vote, and held voting registration drives on college campuses.
