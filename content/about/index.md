# About

*I'm currently a freelance software developer looking at any and all oppurtunities. Some of my past experience is listed below.* 

### Software Developer - Itron
Worked as a software developer at Itron. I was on the DEM (Distributed Energy Management) team which helped manage energy efficiency programs and distributed energy resources. My work ranged from building out features in a large rails monolith to building data pipelines to ingest telemety from smart thermostats.

### Software Developer - Pipeview Inc
Develop and maintain a website for a small business that handles customer booking appointments.

### Field Organizer - Progressive Victory
Spent 6 months in Arizona as a field organizer in the 2024 election becoming familiar with the political landscape. Knocked on over 4000 doors, managed and trained teams to canvass, both remotely and in person to get out the vote, and held voting registration drives on college campuses.
